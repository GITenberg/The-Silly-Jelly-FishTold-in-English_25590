THE SILLY JELLY-FISH.</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="cap">ONCE upon a time the King of the Dragons, who had till then lived as a
bachelor, took it into his head to get married. His bride was a young
Dragonette just sixteen years old,&mdash;lovely enough, in very sooth, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>become the wife of a King. Great were the rejoicings on the occasion.
The Fishes, both great and small, came to pay their respects, and to
offer gifts to the newly wedded pair; and for some days all was feasting
and merriment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="350" height="118" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>But alas! even Dragons have their trials. Before a month had passed, the
young Dragon Queen fell ill. The doctors dosed her with every medicine
that was known to them, but all to no purpose. At last they shook their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
heads, declaring that there was nothing more to be done. The illness
must take its course, and she would probably die. But the sick Queen
said to her husband:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="385" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I know of something that will cure me. Only fetch me a live Monkey&rsquo;s
liver to eat, and I shall get well at once.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A live Monkey&rsquo;s liver!&rdquo;
exclaimed the King. &ldquo;What are you thinking of, my dear? Why! you forget
that we Dragons live in the sea, while Monkeys live far away from here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>among the forest-trees on land. A Monkey&rsquo;s liver! Why! darling, you
must be mad.&rdquo; Hereupon the young Dragon Queen burst into tears: &ldquo;I only
ask you for one small thing,&rdquo; whimpered she, &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t get it for
me. I always thought you didn&rsquo;t really love me. Oh! I wish I had staid
at home with my own m-m-m-mama and my own papa-a-a-a!&rdquo; Here her voice
choked with sobs, and she could say no more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="350" height="362" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>Well, of course the Dragon King did not like to have it thought that he
was unkind to his beautiful young wife. So he sent for his trusty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>servant the Jelly-Fish, and said: &ldquo;It is rather a difficult job; but
what I want you to try to do is to swim across to the land, and persuade
a live Monkey to come here with you. In order to make the Monkey willing
to come, you can tell him how much nicer everything is here in
Dragon-Land than away where he lives. But what I really want him for is
to cut out his liver, and use it as medicine for your young Mistress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>who, as you know, is dangerously ill.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="350" height="129" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>So the Jelly-Fish went off on his strange errand. In those days he was
just like any other fish, with eyes, and fins, and a tail. He even had
little feet, which made him able to walk on the land as well as to swim
in the water. It did not take him many hours to swim across to the
country where the Monkeys lived; and fortunately there just happened to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
be a fine Monkey skipping about among the branches of the trees near
the place where the Jelly-Fish landed. So the Jelly-Fish said: &ldquo;Mr.
Monkey! I have come to tell you of a country far more beautiful than
this. It lies beyond the waves, and is called Dragon-Land. There is
pleasant weather there all the year round, there is always plenty of
ripe fruit on the trees, and there are none of those mischievous
creatures called Men. If you will come with me, I will take you there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Just get on my back.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="391" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Monkey thought it would be fun to see a new country. So he leapt on
to the Jelly-Fish&rsquo;s back, and off they started across the water. But
when they had gone about half-way, he began to fear that perhaps there
might be some hidden danger. It seemed so odd to be fetched suddenly in
that way by a stranger. So he said to the Jelly-Fish: &ldquo;What made you
think of coming for me?&rdquo; The Jelly-Fish answered: &ldquo;My Master, the King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>of the Dragons, wants you in order to cut out your liver, and give it
as medicine to his wife, the Queen, who is sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="350" height="382" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s your little game,&mdash;is it?&rdquo; thought the Monkey. But he kept
his thoughts to himself and only said: &ldquo;Nothing could please me better
than to be of service to Their Majesties. But it so happens that I left
my liver hanging to a branch of that big chestnut-tree, which you found
me skipping about on. A liver is a thing that weighs a good deal. So I
generally take it out, and play about without it during the day-time. We
must go back for it.&rdquo;&mdash;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> Jelly-Fish agreed that there was nothing
else to be done under the circumstances. For,&mdash;silly creature that he
was,&mdash;he did not see that the Monkey was telling a story in order to
avoid getting killed, and having his liver used as medicine for the
fanciful young Dragon Queen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" width="350" height="173" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When they reached the shore of Monkey-Land again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> the monkey bounded
off the Jelly-Fish&rsquo;s back, and up to the topmost branch of the
chestnut-tree in less than no time. Then he said: &ldquo;I do not see my liver
here. Perhaps somebody has taken it away. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> I will look for it. You,
meantime, had better go back and tell your Master what has happened. He
might be anxious about you, if you did not get home before dark.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="350" height="355" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>So the Jelly-Fish started off a second time; and when he got home, he
told the Dragon King everything just as it had happened. But the King
flew into a passion with him for his stupidity, and hallooed to his
officers, saying: &ldquo;Away with this fellow! Take him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> and beat him to a
jelly! Don&rsquo;t let a single bone remain unbroken in his body!&rdquo; So the
officers seized him, and beat him, as the King had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> commanded. That is
the reason why, to this very day, Jelly-Fishes have no bones, but are
just nothing more than a mass of pulp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" width="350" height="396" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>As for the Dragon Queen, when she found she could not have the Monkey&rsquo;s
liver,&mdash;why! she made up her mind that the only thing to do was to get
well without it.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
